## Load the tidyverse library

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r

# Description of dataset “early_january_weather”

The “early_january_weather” dataset contains hourly meteorological data
for January 2013 from three weather stations (LGA, JFK, EWR) in the New
York City area.

There are 15 variables in the early_january_weather data set, including
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The temperature range is
(24.08, 57.92)F. The mean value of relative humidity is 65.48.

The dataset comprises 358 rows and 15 columns.

The mean temperature for the dataset was 39.58 F.

# Create the scatterplot

``` r
scatterplot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Time Hour",
    y = "Temperature (F)",
    color = "Humidity"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Describe patterns

There is a non-linear trend between Temperature and Time Hour. The
temperature Range is from about 24 to 58 F. Clusters of points in the
plot are concentrated in the range of 35-50 F. There’s a consistent
relationship between temperature and humidity. As humidity increases,
temperatures tend to increase.

## Problem 2

# Create the data frame

``` r
zj_df <- tibble(
  random_samp = rnorm(10),                
  logical_vector = ifelse(random_samp>0, TRUE, FALSE),           
  character_vector = sample(letters, 10, replace = TRUE),  
  factor_vector = factor(rep(c("small","medium","large"), length.out = 10)) 
)
```

# Calculate the mean for each variable

``` r
mean_random <- mean(pull(zj_df, random_samp))
mean_logical <- mean(pull(zj_df, logical_vector))
mean_character <- mean(pull(zj_df, character_vector))
mean_factor <- mean(pull(zj_df, factor_vector))
```

After calculation, the random sample has a mean value of 0.14 , the
logical vector has a mean value of 0.5, but the character vector and
factor vector do not have mean values.

# Convert logical, character, and factor variables to numeric

``` r
zj_df$logical_vector_numeric <- as.numeric(zj_df$logical_vector)
zj_df$character_vector_numeric <- as.numeric(zj_df$character_vector)
zj_df$factor_vector_numeric <- as.numeric(zj_df$factor_vector)
```

When converting logical variables to numeric ones, `TRUE` logical
variable takes numeric value of `1` while `FALSE` takes value of `0`.
When taking the mean value of logical variables, R automatically
converts logical variables to numeric ones.

When converting character variables to numeric ones, in this case, a
warning message `NAs introduced by coercion` popped. The character
variables in this data frame are consisted of letters which would induce
NA value when converted to numeric data type. Thus, when taking the mean
value for character value in this data frame, the result shows `NA`.

When converting factor variables to numeric ones, R converts different
factor levels in alphabetical order to match numeric variables if not
specified.However, the corresponding number has no meaning.

This conversion to numeric values doesn’t necessarily help explain what
happens when trying to take the mean because the numeric values may not
hold the same meaning as the original data.
